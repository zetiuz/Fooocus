# Fooocus

Fooocus is an image generating software. Fooocus presents a rethinking of image generator designs. The software is offline, open source, and free, while at the same time, similar to many online image generators like Midjourney, the manual tweaking is not needed, and users only need to focus on the prompts and images. Fooocus has also simplified the installation: between pressing "download" and generating the first image, the number of needed mouse clicks is strictly limited to less than 3. Minimal GPU memory requirement is 4GB.

# Features

Below is a quick list using Midjourney's examples:

| Midjourney | Fooocus |
| - | - |
| High-quality text-to-image without needing much prompt engineering or parameter tuning. <br> (Unknown method) | High-quality text-to-image without needing much prompt engineering or parameter tuning. <br> (Fooocus has an offline GPT-2 based prompt processing engine and lots of sampling improvements so that results are always beautiful, no matter if your prompt is as short as “house in garden” or as long as 1000 words) |
| V1 V2 V3 V4 | Input Image -> Upscale or Variation -> Vary (Subtle) / Vary (Strong)|
| U1 U2 U3 U4 | Input Image -> Upscale or Variation -> Upscale (1.5x) / Upscale (2x) |
| Inpaint / Up / Down / Left / Right (Pan) | Input Image -> Inpaint or Outpaint -> Inpaint / Up / Down / Left / Right <br> (Fooocus uses its own inpaint algorithm and inpaint models so that results are more satisfying than all other software that uses standard SDXL inpaint method/model) |
| Image Prompt | Input Image -> Image Prompt <br> (Fooocus uses its own image prompt algorithm so that result quality and prompt understanding are more satisfying than all other software that uses standard SDXL methods like standard IP-Adapters or Revisions) |
| --style | Advanced -> Style |
| --stylize | Advanced -> Advanced -> Guidance |
| --niji | [Multiple launchers: "run.bat", "run_anime.bat", and "run_realistic.bat".](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus/discussions/679) <br> Fooocus support SDXL models on Civitai <br> (You can google search “Civitai” if you do not know about it) |
| --quality | Advanced -> Quality |
| --repeat | Advanced -> Image Number |
| Multi Prompts (::) | Just use multiple lines of prompts |
| Prompt Weights | You can use " I am (happy:1.5)". <br> Fooocus uses A1111's reweighting algorithm so that results are better than ComfyUI if users directly copy prompts from Civitai. (Because if prompts are written in ComfyUI's reweighting, users are less likely to copy prompt texts as they prefer dragging files) <br> To use embedding, you can use "(embedding:file_name:1.1)" |
| --no | Advanced -> Negative Prompt |
| --ar | Advanced -> Aspect Ratios |
| InsightFace | Input Image -> Image Prompt -> Advanced -> FaceSwap |
| Describe | Input Image -> Describe |

Below is a quick list using LeonardoAI's examples:

| LeonardoAI | Fooocus |
| - | - |
| Prompt Magic | Advanced -> Style -> Fooocus V2 |
| Advanced Sampler Parameters (like Contrast/Sharpness/etc) | Advanced -> Advanced -> Sampling Sharpness / etc |
| User-friendly ControlNets | Input Image -> Image Prompt -> Advanced |

# Download

### Colab

| Colab | Info
| --- | --- |
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zetiuz/Fooocus/blob/main/fooocus_colab.ipynb) | Fooocus

In Colab, you can modify the last line to `!python entry_with_update.py --share --always-high-vram` or `!python entry_with_update.py --share --always-high-vram --preset anime` or `!python entry_with_update.py --share --always-high-vram --preset realistic` for Fooocus Default/Anime/Realistic Edition.

You can also change the preset in the UI. Please be aware that this may lead to timeouts after 60 seconds. If this is the case, please wait until the download has finished, change the preset to initial and back to the one you've selected or reload the page.

Note that this Colab will disable refiner by default because Colab free's resources are relatively limited (and some "big" features like image prompt may cause free-tier Colab to disconnect). We make sure that basic text-to-image is always working on free-tier Colab.

Using `--always-high-vram` shifts resource allocation from RAM to VRAM and achieves the overall best balance between performance, flexibility and stability on the default T4 instance. Please find more information [here](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus/pull/1710#issuecomment-1989185346).

Thanks to [camenduru](https://github.com/camenduru) for the template!

### Linux (Using Anaconda)

If you want to use Anaconda/Miniconda, you can

    git clone https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus.git
    cd Fooocus
    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    conda activate fooocus
    pip install -r requirements_versions.txt

Then download the models: download [default models](#models) to the folder "Fooocus\models\checkpoints". **Or let Fooocus automatically download the models** using the launcher:

    conda activate fooocus
    python entry_with_update.py

Or, if you want to open a remote port, use

    conda activate fooocus
    python entry_with_update.py --listen

Use `python entry_with_update.py --preset anime` or `python entry_with_update.py --preset realistic` for Fooocus Anime/Realistic Edition.

### Linux (Using Python Venv)

Your Linux needs to have **Python 3.10** installed, and let's say your Python can be called with the command **python3** with your venv system working; you can

    git clone https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus.git
    cd Fooocus
    python3 -m venv fooocus_env
    source fooocus_env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements_versions.txt

See the above sections for model downloads. You can launch the software with:

    source fooocus_env/bin/activate
    python entry_with_update.py

Or, if you want to open a remote port, use

    source fooocus_env/bin/activate
    python entry_with_update.py --listen

Use `python entry_with_update.py --preset anime` or `python entry_with_update.py --preset realistic` for Fooocus Anime/Realistic Edition.

### Linux (AMD GPUs)

Note that the [minimal requirement](#minimal-requirement) for different platforms is different.

Same with the above instructions. You need to change torch to the AMD version

    pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio torchtext functorch xformers 
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.6

AMD is not intensively tested, however. The AMD support is in beta.

Use `python entry_with_update.py --preset anime` or `python entry_with_update.py --preset realistic` for Fooocus Anime/Realistic Edition.

### Docker

See [docker.md](docker.md)

## Minimal Requirement

Below is the minimal requirement for running Fooocus locally. If your device capability is lower than this spec, you may not be able to use Fooocus locally. (Please let us know, in any case, if your device capability is lower but Fooocus still works.)

&ast; AMD GPU ROCm (on hold): The AMD is still working on supporting ROCm on Windows.

&ast; Nvidia GTX 1XXX 6GB uncertain: Some people report 6GB success on GTX 10XX, but some other people report failure cases.

*Note that Fooocus is only for extremely high quality image generating. We will not support smaller models to reduce the requirement and sacrifice result quality.*

## Troubleshoot

See the common problems [here](troubleshoot.md).

## Default Models
<a name="models"></a>

Given different goals, the default models and configs of Fooocus are different:

| Task      | Windows | Linux args | Main Model                  | Refiner | Config                                                                         |
|-----------| --- | --- |-----------------------------| --- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| General   | run.bat |  | juggernautXL_v8Rundiffusion | not used | [here](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus/blob/main/presets/default.json)   |
| Realistic | run_realistic.bat | --preset realistic | realisticStockPhoto_v20     | not used | [here](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus/blob/main/presets/realistic.json) |
| Anime     | run_anime.bat | --preset anime | animaPencilXL_v500          | not used | [here](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus/blob/main/presets/anime.json)     |

Note that the download is **automatic** - you do not need to do anything if the internet connection is okay. However, you can download them manually if you (or move them from somewhere else) have your own preparation.

## UI Access and Authentication
In addition to running on localhost, Fooocus can also expose its UI in two ways: 
* Local UI listener: use `--listen` (specify port e.g. with `--port 8888`). 
* API access: use `--share` (registers an endpoint at `.gradio.live`).

In both ways the access is unauthenticated by default. You can add basic authentication by creating a file called `auth.json` in the main directory, which contains a list of JSON objects with the keys `user` and `pass` (see example in [auth-example.json](./auth-example.json)).

## Customization

After the first time you run Fooocus, a config file will be generated at `Fooocus\config.txt`. This file can be edited to change the model path or default parameters.

For example, an edited `Fooocus\config.txt` (this file will be generated after the first launch) may look like this:

```json
{
    "path_checkpoints": "D:\\Fooocus\\models\\checkpoints",
    "path_loras": "D:\\Fooocus\\models\\loras",
    "path_embeddings": "D:\\Fooocus\\models\\embeddings",
    "path_vae_approx": "D:\\Fooocus\\models\\vae_approx",
    "path_upscale_models": "D:\\Fooocus\\models\\upscale_models",
    "path_inpaint": "D:\\Fooocus\\models\\inpaint",
    "path_controlnet": "D:\\Fooocus\\models\\controlnet",
    "path_clip_vision": "D:\\Fooocus\\models\\clip_vision",
    "path_fooocus_expansion": "D:\\Fooocus\\models\\prompt_expansion\\fooocus_expansion",
    "path_outputs": "D:\\Fooocus\\outputs",
    "default_model": "realisticStockPhoto_v10.safetensors",
    "default_refiner": "",
    "default_loras": [["lora_filename_1.safetensors", 0.5], ["lora_filename_2.safetensors", 0.5]],
    "default_cfg_scale": 3.0,
    "default_sampler": "dpmpp_2m",
    "default_scheduler": "karras",
    "default_negative_prompt": "low quality",
    "default_positive_prompt": "",
    "default_styles": [
        "Fooocus V2",
        "Fooocus Photograph",
        "Fooocus Negative"
    ]
}
```

Many other keys, formats, and examples are in `Fooocus\config_modification_tutorial.txt` (this file will be generated after the first launch).

Consider twice before you really change the config. If you find yourself breaking things, just delete `Fooocus\config.txt`. Fooocus will go back to default.

A safer way is just to try "run_anime.bat" or "run_realistic.bat" - they should already be good enough for different tasks.

~Note that `user_path_config.txt` is deprecated and will be removed soon.~ (Edit: it is already removed.)

## Inline Prompt Features

### Wildcards

Example prompt: `__color__ flower`

Processed for positive and negative prompt.

Selects a random wildcard from a predefined list of options, in this case the `wildcards/color.txt` file. 
The wildcard will be replaced with a random color (randomness based on seed). 
You can also disable randomness and process a wildcard file from top to bottom by enabling the checkbox `Read wildcards in order` in Developer Debug Mode.

Wildcards can be nested and combined, and multiple wildcards can be used in the same prompt (example see `wildcards/color_flower.txt`).

### Array Processing

Example prompt: `[[red, green, blue]] flower`

Processed only for positive prompt.

Processes the array from left to right, generating a separate image for each element in the array. In this case 3 images would be generated, one for each color.
Increase the image number to 3 to generate all 3 variants.

Arrays can not be nested, but multiple arrays can be used in the same prompt.
Does support inline LoRAs as array elements!

### Inline LoRAs

Example prompt: `flower <lora:sunflowers:1.2>`

Processed only for positive prompt.

Applies a LoRA to the prompt. The LoRA file must be located in the `models/loras` directory.

## Thanks

Many thanks to [twri](https://github.com/twri) and [3Diva](https://github.com/3Diva) and [Marc K3nt3L](https://github.com/K3nt3L) for creating additional SDXL styles available in Fooocus. 

The project starts from a mixture of [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) and [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) codebases.

Also, thanks [daswer123](https://github.com/daswer123) for contributing the Canvas Zoom!

## Localization/Translation/I18N

You can put json files in the `language` folder to translate the user interface.

For example, below is the content of `Fooocus/language/example.json`:

```json
{
  "Generate": "生成",
  "Input Image": "入力画像",
  "Advanced": "고급",
  "SAI 3D Model": "SAI 3D Modèle"
}
```

If you add `--language example` arg, Fooocus will read `Fooocus/language/example.json` to translate the UI.

For example, you can edit the ending line of Windows `run.bat` as

    .\python_embeded\python.exe -s Fooocus\entry_with_update.py --language example

Or `run_anime.bat` as

    .\python_embeded\python.exe -s Fooocus\entry_with_update.py --language example --preset anime

Or `run_realistic.bat` as

    .\python_embeded\python.exe -s Fooocus\entry_with_update.py --language example --preset realistic

For practical translation, you may create your own file like `Fooocus/language/jp.json` or `Fooocus/language/cn.json` and then use flag `--language jp` or `--language cn`. Apparently, these files do not exist now. **We need your help to create these files!**

Note that if no `--language` is given and at the same time `Fooocus/language/default.json` exists, Fooocus will always load `Fooocus/language/default.json` for translation. By default, the file `Fooocus/language/default.json` does not exist.
